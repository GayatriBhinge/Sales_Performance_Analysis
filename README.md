# RÂ² Values are important in Forecasting Data
What is RÂ² ?
R-Squared (RÂ² or the coefficient of determination) is a statistical measure in a regression model that determines the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable. In other words, r-squared shows how well the data fit the regression model (the goodness of fit). This values is always between 0 to 1.
